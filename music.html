                <h1>Wow! I make music!</h1>
                <p>Not much to say here! I started in high school, hence my stupid fucking pseudonym, and I make music because it's fun!</p>
                <p>I used to upload my music on Soundcloud and Clyp, but don't anymore. I do, however, still have a <a href="https://mystictoaster.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> where I've released my albums over the years. Please don't look at my first three albums 'cause they're mad cringe.</p>
                <p>I currently have unreleased 4 albums (volumes 6, 7, 8, and 9, previewed in brief above) which I <em>promise</em> I'll totally put out <em>soon.</em></p>

                <h1><a href="https://screwheili.bandcamp.com/album/mp3">Modified Pixels 3</a></h1>
                <p>Modified Pixels 3 is a hiphop/vaporwave album I contributed some tracks to, along with a handful of other artists.
                I only made <a href="https://screwheili.bandcamp.com/track/kris-lowlights-space-delinquents-prod-mystictoaster">one song</a> worth listening to. The rest of my contributions are really shite and I was like "hey I don't really wanna have these in the album" but the guy in charge was like "nah they're fire as fuck"
                It was really fuckin' sick-nasty to be able to produce a phat beat that someone else rapped over.</p>
                <p>I remember there being a ton of delay with this project. I think I was involved for over a year before it actually came out.
                I was originally scoped for the project after I posted a shitty ironic Undertale vaportrap remix on Soundcloud to which Screwheili commented something to the effect of "oh yeah, that's the real shit mang"</p>
                <p>To which I replied, "Thanks, you can fuck my wife anytime."</p>

                <h1><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/726110/Overcrowd_A_Commute_Em_Up/">Overcrowd: A Commute 'Em Up</a></h1>
                <p>Overcrowd is a game that many, I'm told, really really enjoy- and I made some of the music for it. Talk about being a part of history.</p>
                <p>I was asked in fuckin' <em>uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</em> April 2018 If one of my songs could be used in the trailer for the Official™ Overcrowd™ Steam™ Greenlight Trailer™™™™.
                    To which I was all like "oh, yeah, sure." Which was all well and good and sexy, but
                    despite being credited, I didn't gain any new listeners or fans from this promotion and I continued as a poor starving artist. <em>Until!</em></p>
                <p>On December of that same year, on my 18th birthday no less, I was contacted yet again by the brave indie developer asking if my music could comprise the games soundtrack! To which I said! "Yes!! Wow!!! Yes please!"
                I was paid £400 for 19 tracks in total, which for a fuckabout college kid who's not <em>especially</em> good at music, is pretty motherfucking awesomesauce. </p>
                <p>Oh, and I absolutely procrastinated the fuck out of this. I was very much rushing to meet deadlines by the end 'cause I'd ended up putting it off for months. Haha, whoops!
                    And to make matters fucking worse, the college cloud storage drive that I had ALL my music files on got FUCKING WIPED by <em>DIPSHIT FUCKHEAD</em> IT techs. I had only the renders I'd uploaded to Soundcloud and Clyp to use, which
                resulted in a lot of the final songs having a spliced, sampled, hip-hop-y vibe to them.</p>
