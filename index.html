        <h1>IT WAS ME. I DID.</h1>
        <h1>HERE IS SOME PROGRAMMING STUFF I LIKE (hey do you like scrollable divs because this sure IS ONE) :</h1>
        <p>I like...!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Assembly!!!!</strong> I have very little experience with low-level computering and NO actual hands-on experience with low level computering but WOW
                it's always so interesting to see how that silly ol' game boy even DID it y'know?? Everything was just a bunch of binary to it: sprites,
                a score counter, music, but it was just like "beep boop" and I was like ":0!!!!!!" It'd be so so so SO cool to homebrew a gameboy game one day
                and have it running on actual hardware! There's a lot of libraries for writing gameboy code in C instead of assembly but where is the COOLNESS
                factor in that??? (Plus there's a performance hit from using a middleman like that).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Linux!!!!!</strong> My favourite Linux distribution is Debian because the icon is CUTE!!! And because it's really the only distro I've ever used!
                I've used a bit of Ubuntu before but it never stuck. One time my younger brother b*rked his laptop's hard drive and I installed Ubuntu on it
                but that's besides the point. I like Debian because I used Raspian as a wee child with all my raspberry pis, so Debian is blanketed in the comforting
                familiarity of childhood nostalgia.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Python!!!!!</strong> It's probably the "funnest" programming language to casually code in. One time my partner sent me a piece of code she wrote for
                Advent of Code and I literally pinned it to the Discord channel because it was SO gorgeous and I was getting light-headed just reading it.
                I was so proud of her!!!!! :)
                <img src="sexycode.png" class="regular-ole-image" alt="absolutely gorgeous code"><br>
                LOOK LOOK LOOOOOK IT'S SO GOOD ARGHGHFDHGGDSFSDF SHE USED TERNARY OPERATORS AND DEFAULT ARGUMENTS AND JUST. WOW. SO READABLE. SO WELL-WRITTEN.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Godot!!!!</strong> It's a silly ole game engine like Unity, only free and open source! I've found it to be dependable enough, with only a few minor
                inconveniences mostly related to committing code to GitHub. Overall it's been very fun, and has allowed me to contribute to a friend's hobby
                game dev project, which is really fun, because I really like being able to spend time with them like this! AND their included language - gdscript -
                is a dynamic language like Python and Javascript, ergo it's a delight to write in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>oh man im a sucker for all sorts of web stuff like rest and json and websockets like</strong> god damn i'm just VIBING i just fuckin love
                rest APIs like you just hit an endpoint and it gives you INFORMATION in a STANDARDIZED FORMAT that's easy to understand??? that's so fucken cool
                AND LIKE???? SOMETIMES WEBSITES JUST HAVE APIS FOR DATA? THAT YOU CAN QUERY????? you can be like (with permission) AY YO TWITTER WHAT TWEET IS THIS
                NUMBER and twitter is like "oh man that's [this tweet BABEYY]" and you're like ":0 WOW I'M GONNA PUT THIS QUERY IN MY WEB APP" and that's so cool
                AND WEBSOCKETS ARE COOL FOR THE SAME REASON BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A BIG OLE SHLURPY STRAW of delicious digital data information and AAAA i wanna make
                a discord bot that shlurps up message information by websocketing up with discord's api instead of like, long-polling that shiznasty or whatever tf.
                ALSO I LIKE JSON HONESTLY IDK IF THAT'S A CONTROVERSIAL OPINION BUT IT'S EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY IF YOU PRETTYFY IT AND THATS OK!!!!!!!!!!!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>i dont wanna alarm nobody but i like resolving promises</strong>. it's just such a nice feeling. yknow? to make an async call, and then
                to just HAVE the data? it's good. it feels good to know what you're doing. I wrote some code recently that makes 84 calls AT ONCE and it basically
                just goes "ok, do those 84 things then gimmie the data when everyones done" and it just WORKS. YES. WOW.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>i love web 1.0</strong> and going further beyond that was a mistake. I HAVE SOME LIMITS. i think react is kind of cool. php can stay. but ALL
                of this G A R B A G E makes me sick. we do not need anything more than basic html semantic tags and THEM'S THE FACTS. or not really. obviously the
                issue is much more complicated than my anger lets on, but like. idk. remember when you could SEE the html in youtube, back in 2005? like, i'm not
                talking about literally viewing the page source or anything, but like. you'd look at it and be like "yup, that's some HTML right there". we need to go
                back to that. wikipedia is pretty good. it has the right idea i'd say. WHATEVER I'M JUST SALTY THAT THINGS KEEP GETTING MORE COMPLEX AND WE DON'T N E E D
                THINGS TO BE MORE COMPLEX OKAY RANT OVER
